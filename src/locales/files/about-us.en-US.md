### Who are we?

This website was developed as part of a school project at NTNU by students in the course IDATT2106. In this project, we have created a web application with the goal of increasing general emergency preparedness in Norway.

The project is non-commercial, and all functionality has been developed strictly for educational purposes.

### What do we do?

**Krisefikser.no** stands out from existing solutions by gathering everything a user needs in one comprehensive application. While other services often focus on a single function – such as emergency calls, information, or maps – Krisefikser.no combines several key aspects of personal emergency preparedness:

- Inventory management
- Reminders
- Resource mapping
- Ongoing event alerts
- Knowledge sharing and recommended actions

### The Team

This project group consists of:

- Eide Zindel, Erlend 
- Bore, Christian Hess
- Merkesdal, André Wikheim
- Seime, Konrad Øye
- Reiher, Jonas
- Smestu, Eskild
- Spook, Sigurd
- Sundvoll Moe, Ole-Thomas
