### Who are we?

This website was developed as part of a school project at NTNU by students in the course IDATT2106. In this project, we have created a web application with the goal of increasing general emergency preparedness in Norway.

The project is non-commercial, and all functionality has been developed strictly for educational purposes.

### What do we do?

**Krisefikser.no** stands out from existing solutions by gathering everything a user needs in one comprehensive application. While other services often focus on a single function – such as emergency calls, information, or maps – Krisefikser.no combines several key aspects of personal emergency preparedness:

- Inventory management
- Reminders
- Resource mapping
- Ongoing event alerts
- Knowledge sharing and recommended actions

### The Team

This project group consists of:

- [Name 1] – [Role, e.g. frontend, backend]
- [Name 2] – [Role]
- [Name 3] – [Role]
- [Name 4] – [Role]

(TODO: Replace the names and roles with actual team members.)
