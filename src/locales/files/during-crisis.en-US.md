### During a crisis

Crisis situations are often unclear, and the information you receive influences the decisions you make. In a crisis, you should seek information from official government channels and from editorially controlled journalistic media that adhere to ethical guidelines such as the Norwegian Code of Ethics for the Press. NRK P1 is the designated emergency radio channel that ensures public access to information—even if other news outlets and official websites are unavailable.

Make sure the information you receive—and share—is reliable.

#### Practical Advice if the Internet or Mobile Network Is Down

If you have a car, you can both listen to the radio and charge your phone in the car, as long as it has power or fuel.

Check if you can enable voice over Wi-Fi on your phone. This allows you to make calls even if the mobile network is down—as long as you have access to the internet. Some apps can also function over the internet even if the mobile network is unavailable.

Check if family members or neighbors have subscriptions on a different mobile network than yours. This way, you can help each other if only one network goes down.

- Have a DAB radio that works even during a power outage. There are different types that run on batteries or can be powered by solar cells or a hand crank.
- Keep a power bank that is charged regularly.
- Have a paper list of important phone numbers in case you need to borrow a phone.
- Check with your local municipality if they have public meeting places or other arrangements for sharing information when power and telecommunications are down.

Crises vary and are often unpredictable. Therefore, it's not possible to give a definitive answer about where it's safest to be when a crisis hits.

In many cases, the safest place is to stay at home. If you've followed the advice on personal preparedness, you’ll be well equipped to manage for several days where you live. Read more about being prepared for a week.

Other times, it may be necessary to leave your home at short notice. Examples of crises that may pose a threat to life and health where you live include extreme weather, large-scale fires, or accidents involving hazardous materials.

In the event of acts of war, you may be instructed to seek shelter. If there are no nearby shelters, you should take cover in a basement or an interior room of a building, avoiding windows. Read more about shelters in Norway.

Seek information from the authorities and follow the advice and guidance provided about where to stay during a crisis.
