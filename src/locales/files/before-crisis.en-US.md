### Before a crisis occurs

Go through what you have in your cupboards, storage room, basement, and garage, and check off the items on the personal preparedness checklist while keeping track of things that could be useful during a crisis.

Once you’ve identified what you’re missing, consider what actions to take. Remember, you don’t need to stock up on everything at once. Start with the most essential items, like water and heat, and gradually build your supply. Are there things that are easy to obtain? Can some of your needs be met through a preparedness buddy? Keep in mind that it’s smart to share resources like cooking equipment, food, and a DAB radio.

No matter how you choose to organize your emergency supplies, it’s wise to review them regularly—at least once a year. Make sure your equipment works as intended, batteries aren’t dead, and food and water are still within their expiry dates.

In a crisis, it’s crucial to receive information from the authorities about what’s happening and what you should do. Therefore, prepare for how you will access information if the power grid, mobile network, or internet stops working.
